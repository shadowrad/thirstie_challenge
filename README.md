## install project
prerequisites: Python 3.8
* create virtual environment
* inside environment run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
* run "python manage.py migrate"
* run "python manage.py runserver"
## endpoints
First,I use a swagger for the 4 crud 
*    "libraries": "http://localhost:8000/libraries/",
*    "books": "http://localhost:8000/books/",
*    "user_library": "http://localhost:8000/user_library/",
*    "library_books": "http://localhost:8000/library_books/"  

I used a new user table to make it easier but on a secure context I would have used  the auth_user table that comes with django 
"library_books": "http://localhost:8000/library_books/"  have 2 query parameters user_id 
for example: http://localhost:8000/library_books/?library_id=2

For the check-out and check-in, I tried to be as close as posible to the REST guideline so  

For check-out you have the endpoint POST http://localhost:8000/LibraryActivity/ because is a creation on the table (a new book was rented for example). 
When the check-in happens it updates the last_activity on the library_books table. 
here is an example of the object to send.  

{
	    	"activity_type": ['RENT'|'BUY'|'RETURN'],
        "library_book":  library_book_id,
        "user": user_id
}

   
  
For the check-in you have the endpoint PATCH http://localhost:8000/LibraryActivity/{LibraryActivityID} it will update the row with the current datetime for the check-in 

## securty improvements 

First use the auth django tables and add the auth token from django rest framework with this you can make use of the roles/permissions features and class managment for security
